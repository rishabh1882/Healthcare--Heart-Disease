# Heart Disease Prediction Machine Learning Models - Capstone Project

Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction repository! This project is the culmination of my capstone study in machine learning, where I've developed predictive models to assess the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators.

## Key Features:

### Dataset:
The models were trained and evaluated on a comprehensive dataset containing a variety of health metrics and patient information.
### Machine Learning Algorithms:
Explore a range of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and more, to identify the most effective model for heart disease prediction.
### Data Preprocessing:
Gain insights into the preprocessing steps taken to clean, normalize, and handle missing data in preparation for model training.
### Model Evaluation: 
Understand the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance, ensuring transparency and reliability in the prediction results.
### Jupyter Notebooks:
Access Jupyter notebooks that walk through each step of the machine learning pipeline, from data exploration to model deployment.
## How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the data analysis, model training, and evaluation processes.
Experiment with different algorithms and parameters to fine-tune the models for your specific use case.
Implement the trained model in your own applications for heart disease prediction.

### Contributing:
Feel free to contribute by opening issues, providing feedback, or submitting pull requests to enhance the project.
