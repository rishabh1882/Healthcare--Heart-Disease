# Heart Disease Prediction Machine Learning Models - Capstone Project

Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction repository! This project is the culmination of my capstone study in machine learning, where I've developed predictive models to assess the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators.

## Key Features:

### Dataset:
The models were trained and evaluated on a comprehensive dataset containing a variety of health metrics and patient information.
### Machine Learning Algorithms:
Explore a range of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and more, to identify the most effective model for heart disease prediction.
### Data Preprocessing:
Gain insights into the preprocessing steps taken to clean, normalize, and handle missing data in preparation for model training.
### Model Evaluation: 
Understand the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance, ensuring transparency and reliability in the prediction results.
### Jupyter Notebooks:
Access Jupyter notebooks that walk through each step of the machine learning pipeline, from data exploration to model deployment.
## How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the data analysis, model training, and evaluation processes.
Experiment with different algorithms and parameters to fine-tune the models for your specific use case.
Implement the trained model in your own applications for heart disease prediction.

## Conclusion of the model
Based on the outcomes obtained from our evaluation of four machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees—we observed that Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 80%,Decision Tree achieved 81.5%, Support Vector Machines exhibited an accuracy of 79%, and Random Forest outperformed the others with an impressive accuracy of 88%. Consequently, we can infer that the Random Forest algorithm proves to be the most effective for our model, demonstrating the highest accuracy of 88%
- In conclusion, the integration of real-time predictors stands as a critical advancement in the contemporary healthcare sector. Through the findings of this project, we have established the capability to promptly predict instances of heart disease by leveraging patient data within our model, specifically employing the Random Forest Algorithm. This achievement signifies a significant stride toward precise and timely heart disease prediction through the application of machine learning methodologies.
