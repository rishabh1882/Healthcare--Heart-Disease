##### Project on Heart Disease Predictions - Healthcare Domain ###############

Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. 
Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as 
coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia) and heart defects youâ€™re 
born with (congenital heart defects), among others.

Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the 
population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of 
the most important subjects in the section of clinical data science. The amount of 
data in the healthcare industry is huge.

Create a ML Model to predict the heart disease (target variable)

1. Load the data in MySQL
2. Create age bins (age groups) in Mysql as a column and create a view for that.
3. Connect the MySQL Database with Python to extract the data for analysis
4. Do proper EDA about each columns. Each row represent 1 patients data
5. Prepare multiple models with proper diagonistics of the model.
6. Create a table for each model and its diagonistics such as accuray,Error
7. Display proper charts and graphs.
8. Create proper repository in Github named as 'Healthcare - Heart Disease'
9. Load the datasets, codes and query for Mysql properly in Github with proper
Readme file with proper descriptions.
10. Write clean and clear code with comments.
11. Create a proper presentation why this model will be helpful in future.
